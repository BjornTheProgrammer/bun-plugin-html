### Developing
You're now ready to start developing! Just make your desired changes to the repository, and run the code by writing a new or running an existing test, to try out your changes!

> [!CAUTION]
> Some tests may fail automatically for you, if you do not have the latest version of bun installed before hand, or if the tests have not been updated to work with the latest version of Bun!
> If this happens upgrade bun with `bun upgrade`, and if the issue persists, attempt overwriting the `test/expected` directory with the `test/generation` directory.
